**Mission:** 
To completely eliminate toxicity from our server would be an impossible task, as the nature of human kind sways like a pendulum. Rather, a balance will be met between preventing those players' behaviors from effecting others, and persuading players against toxicity. 

**Goal:** 
Friendly Community which passively dissuades toxicity. As the definition of toxicity takes many forms, the community itself defines this term. In-game rules, server scripting, and mods will reward players for not engaging in toxic behavior, and dissuade or isolating those who do not. 

**Who's driving?** 
You've got the keys. The entire community, from conception to when you are reading this, has been driven by its members. Every decision, from the name of the discord channels, to the admin/mod structure has been, and will be decided upon by the community. 

**Community Structure:**
Every member's voice is considered. Every suggestion or bit of feedback (whether negative or positive) is very important to us. Changes to the server are made in consensus, and we have a strict change policy, which intends to provide visibility to anybody into the efforts put into growth and development of the community. 

**Moderators:**
 The role of our moderators is not to enforce the rules upon the community, but act as an extension of its members. While moderators and administrators have the right to use their own discretion while interpreting the rules in order to perform their tasks, these rules are ultimately defined by the community members themselves.
